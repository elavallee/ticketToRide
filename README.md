# ticketToRide
[Ticket To Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_to_Ride_(board_game)) is a fun board game that is easy to learn. It has a great mix of randomness and strategic play. The board makes for an excellent opportunity to try out the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) and see if there are some optimal strategies. What was interesting to me, is that maybe you don't want to optimize for the shortest routes between cities. This didn't come as obvious to me, perhaps it was to you. At any rate, use this code to do your own analysis of the game.

The main code to run is ticketToRide.py.
